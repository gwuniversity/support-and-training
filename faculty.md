# [GWIT - GitHub Enterprise for Education](./README.md)

## [Information For Faculty](./faculty.md)
GitHub offers [resources for teachers](https://education.github.com/teachers) and faculty that are not tied directly to GWIT's GitHub Enterprise for Education offering. Training specific to teaching, use cases, and swag for distribution are offered for registered teachers. [Register Here](https://education.github.com/teachers) These benefits involve free use of [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart) for your personal account, once registered. 

[GitHub classrooms](https://classroom.github.com) is a program that's most specifically tied to teaching. Please note that here is **no requirement** for GitHub Enterprise for use. While not required, GWIT can (and will) upon request create an organization within GitHub Enterprise to be used for [managing a course](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/manage-classrooms). This will allow for simpler management of students and a common name space for all course related material. To create the organization for use with GitHub Classrooms, please contact the ITSC and provide the following information:
```
Topic: GitHub Classrooms Organization Request
College:
Department:
Course Number:
Organization Owner: (github username and/or email)
```
