## [Information For Staff](./staff.md)
Many GW staff members may think that GitHub is only for source code or the GWIT team. This isn't true. Nearly any document that would benefit from version control and collaboration can be tracked in a git repository. While it's true that GWIT's current [Storage Management Solutions](https://it.gwu.edu/backup-storage-document-management) offer version control, git is an option available to you. 

In addition to version control, GitHub can also be used to host ad-hoc [projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects), and personal web pages via [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) 

If your department or service group finds itself with a significant number of git repositories, you can contact GWIT to discuss the creation of a custom organization within the GitHub Enterprise. Individuals will find their needs met within the main organizations, but some groups may require secrets sharing and collective runners. To set up that discussion please contact the GWIT:
```
