# GWIT - Github Enterprise for Education

GWIT is able to offer GitHub Enterprise through Microsoft's Github Enterprise for Education program. This cloud based service is avaialble to all of GW's students, faculty, and staff. This service allows for eligible members of the GW community a place to store git repositories remotely to ease collaboration with other members of the GW community as well as take advantage of a substantial **(but not unlimited !)** pool of cloud hosted resources. 

GitHub is a very large platform with frequent additions and changes to features. To claim that all of the expertise lies within GWIT would be a lie to the GWCommunity. What GWIT can commit to is to support this platform and its users, keeping abreast of changes as announced, and learning with you as our community's adoption of GitHub exposes our community's needs.

With that stated, here are a couple of basic instructions and links to get started:

- to join [GW's GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/gwuniversity) you'll need to create a [personal GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home). You can do that [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home). Once you've created your personal account, head to [GW's GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/gwuniversity) and create an issue in the [GWUniversity-SelfInvite](https://github.com/gwuniversity/GWUniversity-SelfInvite) repository to invite yourself. 

- You'll be able to create Teams within the GWUniversity organization that consist of other registered users. To allow members outside of GW to contribute, you'll need to invite them to specific repositories as an [outside contributor](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYqvjWjr-BAxX4F1kFHbRgDM0QFnoECBIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.github.com%2Fen%2Forganizations%2Fmanaging-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories%2Fmanaging-outside-collaborators%2Fadding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization&usg=AOvVaw1TlVDsH6JNAKRgyfn1TzQy&opi=89978449).

## [Information For Faculty](./faculty.md)
GitHub offers [resources for teachers](https://education.github.com/teachers) and faculty that are not tied directly to GWIT's GitHub Enterprise for Education offering. Training specific to teaching, use cases, and swag for distribution are offered for registered teachers. [Register Here](https://education.github.com/teachers) These benefits involve free use of [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart) for your personal account, once registered. 

[GitHub classrooms](https://classroom.github.com) is a program that's most specifically tied to teaching. Please note that here is **no requirement** for GitHub Enterprise for use. [more ...](./faculty.md)

## [Information For Staff](./staff.md)
Many GW staff members may think that GitHub is only for source code or the GWIT team. This isn't true. Nearly any document that would benefit from version control and collaboration can be tracked in a git repository. While it's true that GWIT's current [Storage Management Solutions](https://it.gwu.edu/backup-storage-document-management) offer version control, git is an option available to you. 

In addition to version control, GitHub can also be used to host ad-hoc [projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects), and personal web pages via [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
