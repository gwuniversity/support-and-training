# [GWIT - GitHub Enterprise for Education](./README.md)

## [Information For Students](./students.md)
While not part of the Enterprise for Education offering, students are eligible for free access and discounts to many developer tools via the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Students are eligible for [Github Pro](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans#github-pro), [Pro Level Github Codespaces](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-09-codespaces-for-free-and-pro-accounts/), and [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart).

What happens when I graduate ? 
- In the simplest of terms, you lose access to the GW's Enterprise offering when you lose your status as an active student. Prior to leaving GW, make sure to [transfer repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) that you own and plan to keep.
